# satisfactory-website
I want to make a Website around the Game Satisfactory,
i want to have 3 sites (index, map, calculator) with each having their own
html, css and js file and a bunch of extra stuff that already has their own js file.
The file structure is that i have a css and a js folder
with the html files being outsite with no folder.
